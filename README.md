# Easy Password

Exploring cryptography and computer vision by creating a password management program with facial recognition in C++. Uses openSSL cryptography libraries to protect user data, and currently using openCV to detect specific user (facial recognition).

Also developed a user-facing web application using Ruby-on-Rails.

Goal is to integrate the C++ facial recognition as microservice for the Rails app.
